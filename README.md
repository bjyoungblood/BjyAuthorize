# BjyAuthorize - Acl security for ZF2

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/bjyoungblood/BjyAuthorize.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bjyoungblood/BjyAuthorize)

This module is designed provide a facade for `Zend\Permissions\Acl` that will
ease its usage with modules and applications. By default, it provides simple
setup via config files or by using `Zend\Db` or Doctrine ORM/ODM (via ZfcUserDoctrineORM).

## What does BjyAuthorize do?

BjyAuthorize adds event listeners to your application so that you have a "security" or "firewall" that disallows
unauthorized access to your controllers or routes.

This is what a normal `Zend\Mvc` application workflow would look like:

And here's how it would look like with BjyAuthorize enabled:

## Requirements

 * [Zend Framework 2](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2)
 * [ZfcUser](https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUser) (optional)
 * [ZfcUserDoctrineORM](https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUserDoctrineORM) (optional)

## Installation

### Composer

The suggested installation method is via [composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

```sh
php composer.phar require bjyoungblood/bjy-authorize:1.2.*
php composer.phar require zf-commons/zfc-user:0.1.*
```

### Git Submodule

 1. Install [ZfcUser](https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUser) (follow its installation docs)
 2. Clone this project into your `./vendor/` directory

    ```sh
    cd vendor
    git clone git://github.com/bjyoungblood/BjyAuthorize.git
    ```

## Configuration

Following steps apply if you want to use `ZfcUser` with `Zend\Db`. If you want to use Doctrine ORM/ODM, you should
also check the [doctrine documentation](https://github.com/bjyoungblood/BjyAuthorize/blob/master/docs/doctrine.md).

 1. Ensure that following modules are enabled in your `application.config.php` file in the this order:
     * `ZfcBase`
     * `ZfcUser`
     * `BjyAuthorize`
 3. Import the SQL schema located in `./vendor/BjyAuthorize/data/schema.sql`.
 4. Copy `./vendor/BjyAuthorize/config/module.config.php` to
    `./config/autoload/module.bjyauthorize.global.php`.
 5. Fill in the required configuration variable values in  `./config/autoload/module.bjyauthorize.global.php`

Here is an annotated sample configuration file:

```php

    'bjyauthorize' => array(

        /* this module uses a meta-role that inherits from any roles that should
         * be applied to the active user. the identity provider tells us which
         * roles the "identity role" should inherit from.
         *
         * for ZfcUser, this will be your default identity provider
         */

## Helpers and Plugins

There are view helpers and controller plugins registered for this module.
In either a controller or a view script, you can call
```$this->isAllowed($resource[, $privilege])```, which will query the ACL
using the currently authenticated (or default) user's roles.

Whenever you need to stop processing your action you can throw an UnAuthorizedException and users will see you message on a 403 page.

```php
function cafeAction() {
    if (!$this->isAllowed('alcohol', 'consume')) {
        throw new \BjyAuthorize\Exception\UnAuthorizedException('Grow a beard first!');
    }

    // party on ...
}
```
