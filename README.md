BjyAuthorize
============

Goal
----
This module is designed provide a facade for Zend\Acl that will ease
its usage with modules and applications. By default, it provides simple
setup via config files or by using Zend\Db. This module also comes with
out-of-the-box support for and integration with ZfcUser.

Usage and Configuration
-----------------------
Here is an annotated sample configuration file:
# create this file in config/autoload/BjyAuthorize.local.php

```php
<?php

return array(
    'bjyauthorize' => array(

        // set the 'guest' role as default (must be defined in a role provider)
        'default_role' => 'guest',

        /* this module uses a meta-role that inherits from any roles that should
         * be applied to the active user. the identity provider tells us which
         * roles the "identity role" should inherit from.
         *
         * for ZfcUser, this will be your default identity provider
         */
        'identity_provider' => 'BjyAuthorize\Provider\Identity\ZfcUserZendDb',

        /* role providers simply provide a list of roles that should be inserted
         * into the Zend\Acl instance. the module comes with two providers, one
         * to specify roles in a config file and one to load roles using a
         * Zend\Db adapter.
         */
        'role_providers' => array(

            /* here, 'guest' and 'user are defined as top-level roles, with
             * 'admin' inheriting from user

                )),
            ),

            // this will load roles from the user_role table in a database
            // format: user_role(role_id(varchar), parent(varchar))

            ),
        ),

        // in the ACL. like roles, they can be hierarchical
        'resource_providers' => array(
            'BjyAuthorize\Provider\Resource\Config' => array(
                'pants' => array(),
            ),
        ),

        /* rules can be specified here with the format:
         * array(roles (array), resource, [privilege (array|string), assertion])
         * assertions will be loaded using the service manager and must implement
         * Zend\Acl\Assertion\AssertionInterface.
         * *if you use assertions, define them using the service manager!*
         */

             * access to all controllers and actions unless they are specified here.
             * You may omit the 'action' index to allow access to the entire controller
             */

            ),
        ),
    ),
);
```

Helpers and Plugins
-------------------
There are view helpers and controller plugins registered for this module.
In either a controller or a view script, you can call
```$this->isAllowed($resource[, $privilege])```, which will query the ACL
using the currently authenticated (or default) user's roles.
