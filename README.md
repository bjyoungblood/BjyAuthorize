BjyAuthorize
============

This module is designed provide a facade for `Zend\Permissions\Acl` that will
ease its usage with modules and applications. By default, it provides simple
setup via config files or by using Zend\Db or Doctrine ORM. This module also
comes with out-of-the-box support for and integration with ZfcUser.

Requirements
------------

 * [Zend Framework 2](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2)
 * [ZfcBase](https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcBase)
 * [ZfcUser](https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUser)

Optionally, you can also use
[ZfcUserDoctrineORM](https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUserDoctrineORM) and
use doctrine to fetch roles for your users.

Installation
------------

#### Composer

```sh
php composer.phar require bjyoungblood/bjy-authorize
```

And type `dev-master` when asked for a version to pick.

#### Git Submodule

 1. Install [ZfcUser](https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUser) (follow it's installation docs)
 2. Clone this project into your `./vendor/` directory
```
cd vendor;
git clone git://github.com/bjyoungblood/BjyAuthorize.git;
```

### Configuration

 1. Ensure that this module and it's dependencies are enabled in your `application.config.php` file in the following order:
     * ZfcBase
     * ZfcUser
     * BjyAuthorize
 3. Import the SQL schema located in `./vendor/BjyAuthorize/data/schema.sql`.
 4. Copy `./vendor/BjyAuthorize/config/module.config.php` to
    `./config/autoload/module.bjyauthorize.global.php`.
 5. Fill in the required configuration variable values in  `./config/autoload/module.bjyauthorize.global.php`

Here is an annotated sample configuration file:
```php

         * be applied to the active user. the identity provider tells us which
         * roles the "identity role" should inherit from.
         *
         * for ZfcUser, this will be your default identity provider
         */

         *

        /* role providers simply provide a list of roles that should be inserted
         * into the Zend\Acl instance. the module comes with two providers, one
         * to specify roles in a config file and one to load roles using a
         * Zend\Db adapter.

Helpers and Plugins
-------------------

There are view helpers and controller plugins registered for this module.
In either a controller or a view script, you can call
```$this->isAllowed($resource[, $privilege])```, which will query the ACL
using the currently authenticated (or default) user's roles.

Whenever you need to stop processing your action you can throw an UnAuthorizedException and users will see you message on a 403 page.

```
function cafeAction() {
    if (!$this->isAllowed('alcohol', 'consume')) {
        throw new \BjyAuthorize\Exception\UnAuthorizedException('Grow a beard first!');
    }

    // party on ...
}
```
